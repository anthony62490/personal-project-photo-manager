## Create a Readme File

A tool that allows the user to manage and categorize images based on user-defined tags and rules
The user is able to:
  * Upload images
  * Apply tags (categories) to images
  * Apply rules for managing tags
    * Tags can be given an alias in the event of common misspellings or identical meanings (eg: outside = outdoors)
    * Tags can be instructed to implicate other tags in the event of tags that share common traits (eg: swimming < water)
  * Apply a mass tagging operation on a custom pool of images (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
